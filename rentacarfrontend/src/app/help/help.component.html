        Debit cards are accepted at airport and non-airport locations in the US and Puerto Rico. In Canada, debit cards

        <b>Renting a car with Cash</b>
        <br>
        For security reasons, many Enterprise branches do not accept cash payments. However some branches may accept
        cash or a money order using the "cash qualification" process for customers who do not have a credit card. Check
        below to see if this may apply to your specific situation. We apologize for any inconvenience.

    <accordion-group heading="CAN YOU RENT A CAR UNDER 25 IN THE US AND CANADA?">
      <p>
        Yes, the minimum age to rent a vehicle is 21 years of age. There is no maximum age restriction in the United
        States and Canada. See Exceptions below.
        <br>
        A 'Young Renter Fee' may be applied to your rental, if you are between the ages of 21 and 24.
        The average cost is approximately $20.00 per day but can be higher or lower based on the rental location.
        If you wish to know the cost of the 'Young Renter Fee' you may begin the reservation process to determine the
        exact amount of the fee for the rental location (please remember you will have the option to confirm or cancel
        the reservation).
        <br>
        Renters 21 through 24 years of age may be restricted to specific car classes. Please see exceptions below.

    <accordion-group heading="WILL I BE CHARGED IF I CANCEL ON MY RESERVATION?">
      <p>
        If you did not prepay for your reservation, there will not be a cancellation fee.
        <br>
        If you prepaid for your vehicle the following conditions will apply (applicable in Europe only):
        <br>
        You will not be charged a cancelation fee if you cancel your reservation 7 days ahead of time
        <br>
        If you cancel your booking less than 7 days, but at least 24 hours before your specified pick up time you will
        be refunded the booking amount minus a small cancellation fee. You will need to call 1 (855) 266-9289 to find
        out the exact cancellation fee.
        <br>
        If you cancel your booking in less than 24 hours before your specified pick up time, you will not be entitled to
        a refund.
      </p>
    </accordion-group>
    <accordion-group heading="WILL MY RATE CHANGE IF I MODIFY MY RESERVATION?">
      <p>
        Possibly - rental rates can change on a daily basis so changing the dates or number of days may change the daily
        rate.
        <br>
        Reservations booked on a third party website must be canceled through the third party website. Reservations
        agents cannot change reservations booked on these websites nor can you cancel them on the Enteprise.com website.
        Please return to the website where you originally booked the reservation.
